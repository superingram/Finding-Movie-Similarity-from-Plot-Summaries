# Finding-Movie-Similarity-from-Plot-Summaries

In the Movie Similarity project, we will quantify the similarity of movies based on their plot summaries available on IMDb and Wikipedia, then separate them into groups, also known as clusters. We will employ tokenization, stemming and a TF_IDF vectorizer to determine which movies are most similar to each other.  We'll create a dendrogram to depict how closely the movies are related to each other.
